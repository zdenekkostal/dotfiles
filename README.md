# Welcome to my dotfiles 

To install everything from scratch just open the `Terminal` app and run the following:

```bash
# Install brew - yeah, Macports would be nicer but it's missing a lot of packages I use :(
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Install Oh my ZSH
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

brew install asdf git tig tmux fzf direnv docker ripgrep gnupg svgo tldr starship git-delta antibody
brew install --HEAD neovim
brew cask install alacritty 
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-hack-nerd-font
brew install TankerHQ/homebrew-repo/ruplacer
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

This is a bare repository, which has no work tree:

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:zdenekkostal/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
dotfiles config status.showUntrackedFiles no

# Beware if your home folder is not empty and you don't won't to override everything
dotfiles restore .
```

Interact with the repository with the `dotfiles` command (specified in `.zshrc`) â€“ use it like any other git repo (`dotfiles status`, `dotfiles add ...`, etc.).

Also, don't forget to download excellent [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
