# Welcome to my dotfiles

To install everything from scratch just open the `Terminal` app and run the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zdenekkostal/dotfiles/master/bin/install-dotfiles)"
```

This is a bare repository, which has no work tree. Interact with the repository with the `dotfiles` command (specified in `.zshrc`) â€“ use it like any other git repo (`dotfiles status`, `dotfiles add ...`, etc.).
